The experiments we performed are available under the folders:
	1. autoencoder
	2. interpolation

Our main implementation is in python file model.py
We trained the GAN architecture present in model.py using algorithm present in trainer.py

The implementation can be tested on the test dataset present in 'sample_test_ds' directory using the file test_model.py

The weights achieved for the discriminator and the generator networks during training's last saved checkpoint can be found in folder 'weights'
